Correct Understanding of Reference Flow (API, Library, Test)
In .NET, the reference direction must always flow downward, 

product (Library) → productApi (API) → product.Test (xUnit)
                1 ref.              2 ref

Library Project goes into API.
API goes into Test.
Test never goes into API or Library.
